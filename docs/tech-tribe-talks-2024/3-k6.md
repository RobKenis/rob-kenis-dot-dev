# Performance and load testing with K6

## Introducing K6

It's open source, it's a CLI tool with developer friendly APIs (read: JavaScript), it does performance and load 
testing, and most importantly: _it's free_. It also has [browser automation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6-browser/running-browser-tests/).

```shell
brew install k6
k6 run test.js
```

## Writing tests

Tests consist of 2 main parts: **requests** and **assertions**, it's JavaScript, you can do what you want. For reporting, tests can be grouped
inside a **group**, but this is mostly for reporting purposes.

After the tests have finished, K6 will present a bunch of checks (e.g. the status is 200). We are doing performance testing, we don't care that
much about the checks. We're talking about metrics, and this is where K6 really shines. The results contain **metrics** on requests and responses,
everything in percentiles.

Test configuration is passed using [options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/reference/), this is the way to configure
test parameters in a readable format.

## Reporting

K6 supports a custom [summary](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/end-of-test/custom-summary/) where you can address all available
metrics. There's also a web dashboard, which generates a dashboard.
