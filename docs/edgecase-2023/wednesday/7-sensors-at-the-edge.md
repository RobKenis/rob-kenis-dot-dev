# Setting up Sensors at the Edge and Managing the OS (Workshop)

!!! note "We tried reprovisioning the RaspberryPi's. We have 30% packet loss. We'll try again tomorrow."

The workshop uses https://github.com/rancher/dashboard to deploy some containers. The pods send some messages over MQTT and another container enables an LED on a RPi
