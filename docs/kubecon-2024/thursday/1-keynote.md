to your first PR in open source tooling.

## WebAssembly

Virtual Machines are the OG of cloud computing, kinda slow, kinda powerful. Containers take a couple seconds to start, consume
fewer resources and are the middleweight of cloud computing. WebAssembly is even more lightweight, a WebAssembly application can
be started in half a millisecond. So how do we run [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) in Kubernetes?

Introducing [Spin Operator](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator) to run WebAssembly applications in a WASM runtime
instead of a container runtime.
