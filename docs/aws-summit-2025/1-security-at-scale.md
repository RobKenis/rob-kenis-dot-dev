# AWS Security at scale

## Cloud security challenges

The job of CISOs is getting harder, but innovation is important to companies. Security people are still
challenged in combining a good security posture and stopping innovation in companies. It's also hard to
find security experts, but also hard to find developers who understand security.
With the scale of organizations and the rise of microservices, the landscape is becoming a little
complex. AI and bots are creating a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Data protection needs
to be thought about more, especially in Europe, because of GDPR.

## Accelerate innovation

When you are responsible for keeping your infrastructure and applications secure, you need
to be handed the building blocks to keep it secure from the beginning.

### Secure by design

Graviton chips are designed to be secure from the beginning. Memory is encrypted by default,
everything that goes from the chip into the peripherals are encrypted by default. This means
communication from the chip to for example the VPC card is secure by default, reducing the attack
vector.
