# Modern Development Environments

> From static workstations to dynamic AI-aware systems.

This talk is brought to you by [Coder](https://coder.com/).

## How developers code today

This ranges from local development with difficult governance and higher risks of escapes, to virtual
desktops and managed VMs. None of these are ideal, they bring developer inefficiency and absence of
oversight. _Why is everyone hating on local development so much?_

## How developers code with CDEs

_This means Cloud Development Environments_. The development environment is closer to the CICD systems,
hopefully improving efficiency on the developer side. This move to cloud environments is ready for
the AI wave. The provider needs to extend the infrastructure they provide for humans to infrastructure
for agents. _Why is everyone comparing AI agents to junior engineers? Stop it!_

### Coding Agents in CDEs

When a developer and an AI agent operate on the same system, the developer has more permissions on source
systems and the development sandbox. The AI agent is more restricted on the actions it can do and the
resources it can reach. _WHY IS THIS TALK ABOUT AI AGENTS?_ This talk was brough to you by
[AI Agents](https://coder.com/solutions/ai-coding-agents).

## Use cases for Coder

_I would like if you would actually show something instead of trying to sell me AI agents, but whatever._
Coder has a [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/coder/coder/latest/docs) which
seems pretty nice to manage Coder Environments, with or without agents.
