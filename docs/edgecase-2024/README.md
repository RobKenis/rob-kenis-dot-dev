# Edgecase 2024

## Reflecting on 3 years of change

Hey ho let's go, Gerrit survived the stairs. I promise there's some context to that, but it doesn't matter. 
In the last couple years, Kubernetes has moved more to the Edge, to the not so trivial locations. What has improved
over the years? [k3s](https://k3s.io/) made your life a little easier in the hands of Rancher. Next to Sidero catching
up with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/). But without some extra layers, Kubernetes is not production worthy. 

Three years ago, the biggest hurdle with Kubernetes was "why would you bring such complex technology to the edge?".
The technology is already complex, but then the environment is unpredictable. And that feedback is exactly the same today.
