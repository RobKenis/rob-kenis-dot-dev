# Trends shaping the future of cloud native and edge

Brought to you by [ARM](https://www.arm.com/).

## Vendor-owned Open Source

Whatever we do in the industry, we are dependent on open source. Open source drives technology innovation,
and that drives business innovation. Over the last few years, we've seen the trend that companies become
more or less restrictive to open source licensing, looking at you Elastic and Redis. All companies need to
be sustainable, so this is not a bad thing.

A few months ago, [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) took a differnt approach. The code is open source, but the
releases aren't.

When using open source, think about the licenses that they use. Can you automate compliance checks? Who is
behind the project? The maintainers might want to keep the project open source, but the CEO doesn't. You need
to know what you're building on top off, and everything can change quickly.

## Finding community

In 2017, Kubernetes was around but pretty early, but containers were already big. Communities were forming and
7 years later, they've becoming a big thing.

## The age of AI

> The era of large models over, we will now focus on specialized models.

[Code LLama](https://www.llama.com/code-llama/), [FinGPT](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT) and
[Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com/) are smaller, specialized models build for a specific domain.

Software development is changing, you build your analytics on your big server and IoT on your Edge ARM device.

What is cloud native AI? Leverage cloud computing, network and storage to deploy and run your AI workloads.
This comes with a bunch of new challenges: unreliable network, cost and security, the data is harder to manage.

The ecosystem is growing, from the CNCF AI working group, to "Safety by design" initiatives and learning groups
for students.
