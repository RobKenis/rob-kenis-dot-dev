# Trends shaping the future of cloud native and edge

## Vendor-owned Open Source

Whatever we do in the industry, we are dependent on open source. Open source drives technology innovation,
and that drives business innovation. Over the last few years, we've seen the trend that companies become
more or less restrictive to open source licensing, looking at you Elastic and Redis. All companies need to
be sustainable, so this is not a bad thing.

A few months ago, [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) took a differnt approach. The code is open source, but the
releases aren't.

When using open source, think about the licenses that they use. Can you automate compliance checks? Who is
behind the project? The maintainers might want to keep the project open source, but the CEO doesn't. You need
to know what you're building on top off, and everything can change quickly.
