# Cloud Abuse at Scale

> Cloud Abuse at Scale: How Cybercriminals Exploit Free Tiers for Profit

There's multiple ways to abuse free tiers on cloud providers, but the talk is about:

- Automate the creation of cloud account that allows for CICD tooling
- Clone a repo and start a build to launch a crypto miner
- Repeat
- Make money

## The idea

Make a container definition where you launch a crypto miner. Wrap the miner into another
script and do not use the official binaries to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

Light talk, lovely speaker
