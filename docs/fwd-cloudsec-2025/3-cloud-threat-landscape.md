# Cloud Threat Landscape

> A Candid Perspective on the Cloud Threat Landscape: What’s Real, What’s Not, and What Should Change

## What's a threat landscape

It's a view of current threats, real incidents, adversary behaviors and trends.

What's the problem with cloud? It's fragmented, underdeveloped and hard to find things.

## Key Observations

1. Identity and Standing Access Exploitation
2. SaaS is the new data plane
3. Pipeline platform and supply chain integrity

- The good: The big part of reports include detections and security considerations
- The bad: Not a lot of reports include threat actors. Not a lot of mapping on MITRE ATTACK.
- The ugly: The big cloud vendors don't report on cloud specific threats
